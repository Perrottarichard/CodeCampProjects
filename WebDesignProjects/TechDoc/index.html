            In an emergency situation, if your Phone is powered on and within
            the service area, you can make emergency calls even if the screen is
            locked or there is no mobile reception. The emergency call feature
            is subject to your local regulations and Internet service provider.
            Network issues or environmental interference may lead to failed
            emergency calls. In emergency situations, do not rely on your Phone
            as your only method of communication.

          <p>
            VoLTE (Voice over LTE) allows both call and data services to be
            carried on the same 4G network, which means you can use the Internet
            even while making calls. VoLTE also provides you with shorter call
            connection times and higher quality voice and video calls. Both of
            your Phone's SIM card slots support 4G, VoLTE, and VoWiFi, so there
            is no need to switch SIMs back and forth.

            Want to change the content, such as photos and videos, background
            music, or video template for your Highlights? You can edit a
            Highlights album picking out the content, background music, and

            AI leading role stories: When a long video contains multiple
            characters, you need to watch the entire video repeatedly just to
            find the video segments with the particular character that you are
            looking for. With the AI leading role stories, it can save you the
            hassle of sorting through and editing all the clips to create an
            edited video focusing on the character you select. When your device
            screen is off and charging with a battery level higher than 50%, the
            system automatically analyzes characters in the video, and creates
            an arrangement of the best clips of the character in the video. When
            you want to view the video again, you can swipe up to view the
            generated video clips. Currently, the system can perform this on 15
            seconds to 3 minutes long videos.
          </p>

            Want to edit a picture you just took to make it even better? You can
            use the Gallery's editing features to crop, rotate, and apply a
            variety of effects (such as graffiti, personalized watermarks, and
            filters to your photos to make them more striking
          </p>
          <p>
            Browsing through old photos or videos can bring back some of your
            most precious memories. Your photos and videos are stored in your
            device's Gallery. You can view them by time, location, or by album.
