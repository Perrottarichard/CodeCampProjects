      <h4>Quality Assurance</h4>
      <p id="QA">
        At Fern's Online Bookstore, we strive to provide the highest standard of
        quality to all of our customers. To ensure this, we personally check
        each book by reading it before shipping to make sure it meets our
        standards. For this reason, some items may have highlighting,
        ear-marking, marginalia, or coffee stains.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4>How to Order</h4>
      <p id="How to Order">
        We make ordering your favorite books as easy as making a few clicks,
        entering your payment information (cash only), taking our survey,
        passing a background check, filling in our membership application (and
        getting approved), and then waiting for standard USPS mail to deliver
        the cash you've sent. Upon receipt of cash, our staff will then perform
        quality assurance. Once quality assurance is approved, we will ship your
        order on the 1st of the next month. If the item you ordered is not up to
        our standards, we will refund the money within two calendar years after
        receiving your signed and notarized application for a cash refund.
        Buying was never this easy!
      </p>

      <h4>Price Matching</h4>
      <p id="Price Matching">
        Because we know you work hard for your money, and we strive to provide
        you with the best online shopping experience, we will match any of our
        competitors prices (excluding Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Barnes and Nobles,
        Lazada, Shopee, and most other major e-commerce retailers and
        wholesalers). All you have to do is submit the easy online form and we
        will respond within 23 working days after the next vernal equinox.
